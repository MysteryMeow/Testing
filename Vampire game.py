      The worst storm this century, the papers would later say.\n
      up in the distance, just off a short dirt path, you see a large house.\n 
      Some might even say a mansion. \n
      Although from the looks at this distance in the storm it appeared to be long abandoned.\n

Out of breath, and soaked to the core, you swing open the large oak door.\n
To your supries, it opens easily for such a large door.\n

The lightening outside paints preodic snapshots of light though the windows.\n

Just off to the left of the entrance,a painting catches your eye\n
Straining to see in the dim light, your eyes race across the painting.\n
It is a painting of a man with a  sorrowful expression, in chrimson and black robes, sitting at a dinner table.\n
As you study the painting... you realize somthing isnt right....\n
What is that he is eating?... it resembles... dare I say... parts of people!\n
Shocked you stagger back,the lightening flashing, in this moment you realize...\n
The man in the painting now has a sinister gaze and a wide smile devious smile, revealing ghastly teeth and fangs.\n 
In that moment, the lightening strikes again, and thats when you see it...\n 
The same man, aged greatly, but recognizeable still, standing beside the painting. \n
Frozen in shock... eye's locked with his...thats when you hear it...\n
A histarlical cackling errupts from what seems like all around you\n
and a voice ripples though you like a shockwave, speaking a language you have never heard before.\n
Instantly the feeling of Doom surrounds you, with what feels like a million eyes gazed fixed on you.\n
As quickly as he appeared, the man vashishes...\n
However. You feel a shap pain in your right sholder. Your eyes glance to the side in terror.
A pale hand, that resemblems more a claw then a hand, firmly grabs your right sholder\n
